## Profilers

*Tools that provide profiling and tracing information to aid program optimization*
* [BTrace](https://github.com/jbachorik/btrace) - a safe, dynamic tracing tool for the Java platform.
* [Chronon](http://chrononsystems.com) - Record your entire java program. Replay on any machine.
* [GCViewer](https://github.com/chewiebug/GCViewer) - GCViewer is a tool that visualizes verbose GC output.
* [Java Mission Control](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaseproducts/mission-control/java-mission-control-1998576.html) - Continuously collect low level and detailed runtime information enabling after-the-fact incident analysis.
* [jHiccup](http://www.azulsystems.com/jHiccup) - jHiccup is an open source tool designed to measure the pauses and stalls associated with an applicationâ€™s underlying Java runtime platform.
* [JProfiler](https://www.ej-technologies.com/products/jprofiler/overview.html) - Helps resolve performance bottlenecks, pin down memory leaks and understand threading issues.
* [Riemann JVM Profiler](https://github.com/riemann/riemann-jvm-profiler) - JVM agent which sends function-level profiler telemetry to a Riemann server for analysis, visualization, and storage.
* [Swiss Java Knife](https://github.com/aragozin/jvm-tools) - Small set of tools for JVM troublshooting, monitoring and profiling.
* [Takipi](https://www.takipi.com/) - Tells you when and why code breaks in production.
